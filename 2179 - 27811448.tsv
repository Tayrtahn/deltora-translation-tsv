begin the coronation⏎
ceremony!"		
28010600	主席大臣て何?	What is a chief minister?	Hey、who’s that kid?	I'm pretty sure these two lines are intended to help define the difference between a “chief advisor” and just an “advisor” for young Japanese readers who might not be familiar with the kanji or terms. 主席 (“main+chair” -> “chairman” -> “chief”)	
28010700	一番えらい大臣て事さ	He's the greatest minister.	"Shh! That’s Jarred…⏎
the Prince’s friend"	"It sounds pretty silly to clarify it in English, so we can repurpose them."

He puts on the belt and we get a big two-screen shiny effect. The crowd gasps."	
42810118	(これが……これがベルトの力!?)	(This… this is the power of the belt!?)	(Whoa! The Belt!)	Changing this so Jarred seems less incredulous 	
21810b24	おお、われらが王 エンドン様!⏎ベルトが 王位を みとめましたぞ!	"Oh, our king Endon! ⏎The belt has acknowledged your throne!"	"All hail King Endon!⏎

Okay、let’s try making⏎
a dagger next"	"I think “freshly” is referring to a style of sword. Something about “disobedient”, which is literally derived from “stab-shield”?Dagger sounds like a decent fit.

21810b24	なんだと!? バカな!	What!? You idiot!	What? What do you see?		
21030b24	どこだ?	Where is it?	"Someone coming to help⏎
you、perhaps? Fool!"

searching for you.⏸
You must stay in hiding⏎
and wait"	Changing this a bit to fit the book.	
45030718	でも、いつか……	But someday...	"If the Shadow Lord can⏎
be patient、so can we"	"This is Sharn’s line in the book, but she’s done talking in the game, so Jarred gets it instead."
